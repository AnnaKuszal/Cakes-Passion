**Simple HTML&CSS project**

The first individual project at the Bootcamp 'Web Developer'. A simple website prepared to practice basics of HTML and CSS. Used elements: a simple form, some CSS effects (transformations), photos and fonts from external resources.

**The website has been prepared according to the previously given general layout. Colors, photos, icons and other styles have been chosen by the author.** It was coded in bootcamp online editor - no packages or other files haven't been used at that basic project.

Open with: **Chrome**.
